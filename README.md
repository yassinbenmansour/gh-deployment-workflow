# gh-deployment-workflow

This is a simple project that showcases how to use GitHub Actions for continuous deployment (CI/CD) to GitHub Pages. The repository contains a basic `index.html` file with a message "Hello, GitHub Actions!" and automatically deploys any changes to this file to GitHub Pages.

## Workflow

1. Every time a change is made to the `index.html` file in the `main` branch, the GitHub Actions workflow is triggered.
2. The workflow builds and deploys the static website to GitHub Pages.

## Access

The deployed website can be accessed at:
